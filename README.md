A simple React Poster project. It has a front end and a back end so that you can write a post and have the post saved to the db. 

To start this project, do the following steps:
  Clone down
  cd into project root directory
  run `npm install` which will install the dependencies for both the front and back end subdirectories
  run `npm start` which will start up both the front end and back end servers
  You can then navigate to localhost to see it in action
